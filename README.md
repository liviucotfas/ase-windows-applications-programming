# Windows Applications Programming

## Prerequisites
- Microsoft Windows: the applications developed during the first few labs also work on Linux and macOS, but the ones in the following labs can only be developed and will only run on Windows. If you use Linux / macOS as the primary operating system, you can choose to install Windows in a Virtual Machine. If you don't have a Windows license, you can obtain a Windows 11/10 Education license from https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students by validating your student status.
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 / 2019: can be downloaded from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community or https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students. Make sure that the .NET desktop development workload is installed.
